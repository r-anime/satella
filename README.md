# Satella (AnimeMod 2.0)

This is a project to allow for more flexible automod like rule modules to run for r/anime.

(TODO) This will read the config from the automod config (TODO elaborate how to link it to a rule module)

This project is meant to be run in conjunction with [modbot](https://github.com/r-anime/modbot), which will populate the RabbitMQ messages that this app will consume and process.

TODO: How to setup this project and run it.
